# Portal-Math
A c++ header that contains more maths functions.
portalmath.h is made up of four parts: constant, complex number and quaternion, algebra, geometry.

Constant
This part contains some maths contants, like pi and e.

Complex Number and Quaternion
This part contains some operators about complex numbers and quaternions.
Use the structure "complex_number z" to define a complex number z.
If z is a complex number, use "z.Re" and "z.Im" to show z's real part and imaginary part.
